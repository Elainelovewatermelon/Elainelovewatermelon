**Project Title: House Price Prediction Model**

**Objective**: To develop a predictive model for house prices using extensive data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning techniques.

**Tools and Libraries Used**: Python, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, TensorFlow Decision Forests.

**Project Description**:
This project aims to accurately predict house prices based on various features from a comprehensive dataset. Key steps in the project include:

- **Data Preparation**: The project starts with the loading and cleaning of house sales data. This includes handling missing values, normalizing price scales, and refining address data for consistency.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visual tools like pair plots and heatmaps are used to identify correlations between features, explore relationships with house prices, and detect outliers. This step helps in understanding the data dynamics and preparing it for modeling.

- **Feature Engineering**: Categorical data is transformed to numerical codes to reduce variability and enhance model interpretability. Efforts are focused on ensuring that the data is model-ready, optimizing both readability and predictive power.

- **Model Development and Validation**: The data is split into training, validation, and testing sets. A RandomForest regression model is trained using TensorFlow Decision Forests, focusing on achieving the lowest possible RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and high accuracy.

- **Outcome and Reporting**: The final model is used to predict house prices on a test dataset. The results are then analyzed to understand the impact of different features on house prices. Predictions are saved and documented in a CSV file for any further operational use or analysis.

**Conclusion**: This project encapsulates the use of advanced data science techniques to develop a reliable house price prediction model. The approach combines traditional statistical methods with modern machine learning frameworks to deliver actionable insights and predictions.
